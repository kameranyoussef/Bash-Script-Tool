# Bash-Script-Tool
Junk.sh - This tool is to restore files with other additional functionality.

This project is a file recovery and management tool that I created to solve a common problem.
The tool offers the following functionalities: 
Recover, which lets the user restore a specific file from the directory to the current directory; 
Delete, which asks the user to confirm before deleting the directory contents; 
Display, which reports the total usage in bytes directories for all users in the system; 
Monitor, which tracks and updates the file creation, modification and deletion events in directory every 15 seconds; 
and Terminate, which stops the monitor script if it is running.
